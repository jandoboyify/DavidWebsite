            <u>The Optional Listening Project</u>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Optional Listening Project is something I’ve started that would allow me to release a collection of tracks every 4-8 weeks without the label of an album or EP. This is in no way a rebellion, nor do I have anything against the terms. I personally feel that the way I produce and write, releasing this music with such labels makes no sense. I take my art and the process very seriously, but more importantly I do this for myself and for fun, and enjoy sharing such work with friends and family. I realize I am on this path of continuous learning, and my work over time would hopefully showcase that. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Originally, this project started as one EP (Optional Listening No. 1). I realized the idea of the title along with the telephone switchboard on the cover art could expand further. The title Optional Listening is self explanatory in what is expected of the listener, and the switchboard illustrates the idea of being able to connect a source to many different destinations, those destinations in my case being the Optional Listening collections released over time. Hope you enjoy this project, I am always open to feedback!</b></p>

        <p class="about"><b>Born and raised in Tucson, AZ, David has always been surrounded by music. Since the age of 2, David has been playing the drums. He began learning to read music while playing in the concert and jazz ensembles in middle school. Years following, while becoming more interested in keyboards/synthesizers and the modulation of sound, David also started to find an interest in music production and sound engineering. In 2014, David was an attendee of the Grammy Foundation’s Grammy Camp-St. Paul, MN in the Audio Engineering career track. Today, he works towards a BA in Audio Design and Production at Columbia College Chicago, hoping someday to record for like-minded artists in a studio, while also producing and performing some of his own music. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        David has performed with several of Columbia’s music ensembles and students, ranging various genres. He is currently apart of the music department’s R&B and Recording and Performance Showcase ensembles. Outside of school, David is also the current drummer for the band Flora. This summer, he interned at Stonecutter Recording Studios, and is currently interning at Gravity Studios in Chicago. While at Stonecutter, David assisted owner and chief engineer Chris Steinmetz on the production of various projects, most notably playing drums on four of the five tracks of singer/songwriter Chawla’s debut EP Still Waiting (https://open.spotify.com/album/1idG2k8CVV7lF9PSfzvR0C).</b></p>
